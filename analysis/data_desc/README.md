# Experiment Data Description
There are totally 1,211,874 scenes on rscloudmart whose capture date are in 01/05/2017 \~ 01/09/2017. 

Since rscloudmart only provide scenes in China. All the scenes are in the region whose longitude is in 73°E \~ 135°E and latitude is in 3°N \~ 53°N

After we map the longtitude and latitude directly to the Eurlic space, we can calculate the area.

The area of the interested region is 8 * 8 = 64
